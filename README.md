# four-card-feature-section-master
My third challenge



A clean, fully responsive front-end project built with pure HTML and CSS — no frameworks, no libraries.
The goal was to create a sleek feature section that looks perfect on all screen sizes, focusing on accessibility, performance, and modern best practices.

🛠️ Built With
HTML5

CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, CSS Variables, Media Queries)

📚 Design Decisions
Mobile First Approach: Started design from smaller screens up to larger desktops.

CSS Grid + Flexbox: Used Grid for overall layout and Flexbox for finer control within cards.

Semantic HTML: Helps in SEO and assists screen readers.

Accessibility: Focused on color contrast and keyboard navigation.

Performance: No unnecessary libraries, only what's needed.

📈 Potential Improvements
Introduce micro-interactions (hover effects, smooth transitions).

Implement dark/light mode support using prefers-color-scheme.

Setup PostCSS or Sass for better build management (auto-prefixing, minification).

Test compatibility with older browsers (e.g., Safari 13+).

Add detailed code comments for complex CSS parts.


No build process required — simple and fast! ⚡
